## üéØ Main Proposal Document
**Complete RDC MVP IoT Platform Proposal**: [https://ryanmkelley.github.io/rdc_quote_pages/quote.html](https://ryanmkelley.github.io/rdc_quote_pages/quote.html)

*Comprehensive 16-week development proposal including project overview, timeline, cost analysis, portfolio, architecture, technical implementation, and risk assessment.*

## üìã Project Overview

This repository contains the complete project proposal for developing a multi-tenant IoT Safety Monitoring Platform using AWS IoT Core architecture. The platform will support:

- **Radiation badge monitoring** for safety compliance
- **Gas detector integration** for hazardous environment monitoring  
- **Real-time alerting and event management**
- **Multi-tenant architecture** with customer data isolation
- **React-based dashboard** with mobile responsiveness
- **WebSocket real-time monitoring** capabilities

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

- **AWS IoT Core** for device connectivity and management
- **Lambda Functions** for serverless data processing
- **DynamoDB + TimeStream** for scalable data storage
- **API Gateway** for secure API access
- **React Dashboard** for user interface
- **Multi-tenant security** with VPC isolation
